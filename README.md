# CAMOGEN

camogen is a tool for creating visual art. It includes a library of 
inputs and effects (WebGL Shaders) that can be combined in a graph 
system, and each individual effect parameter can be tweaked or driven 
by another graph subsystem.

camogen is built on webgl and provides a framework for visually
composing shader graphs. You can create shaders and edit code within
the app
