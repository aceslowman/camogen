## To Do

- [improvement] enable decorators with web pack and babel
    >  create react app doesn't allow for the use of decorators, so for the time being I am using the built-in mobx functions. when I revisit this I need to look into why the babel configuration won't apply.
- [feature] should be able to add and remove each type of shader node
- [bug] There's a brief flash before the resolution uniform is sent to a shader
- [improvement] handle workspace and canvas dimensions in mobx
- [feature] title area should be a kind of console text tool
- [feature] allow   shader graph to be attached to another one in the linked list

## Doing

- [improvement] use mobx for state management

## Done

- [component] ConsoleBar
- [component] HelpText
